Server checks when first request is arrived

is servlet is loaded
if it is not loaded
              load the servlet
              create an instance of the servlet
              calls the init() method by web container
              calls the service() method by web container
              calls the destroy() method if needed



  how web container handles the request:

            map the request with the servlet in the web.xml file
            creates request and response object for this request
            calls the init() method by the web container
            calls the service() method on the thread
            public service method internally calls the protected service method
            protected service method internally calls the type (which type is belongs to)
            if it is belonged to post method then internally calls the doPost() method
            generate the response and send to the client
            web container delete the request and response object
            the thread is contained in a thread pool which is deleted depends upon the servlet             

Public void service(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response)
{
 internally it converts as 
 HttpServletRequest 
 HttpServletResponse
} 

protected void service(HttpServletRequest request,HttpServletResponse response)
{
 internally do
if(method.equals("GET"))
call the doGet()

else 
Call the doPost()

}
