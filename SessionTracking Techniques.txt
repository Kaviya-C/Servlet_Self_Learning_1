Session means -- period of time  or interval of time

Session Tracking is a way to maintain the state of an 
object between login to logout


http protocol is an  stateless  
so we need to maintain the state by using session tracking techniques


there are 4 ways 

Cookies
Hidden Form Field
URL rewritting
Http Session


stateless  --->  each request is considered to be as new request


why we use :
             Session Tracking:
              TO RECOGNIZE THE USER


Lets See about Cookie:

persistent cookie   -- valid for multiple session --->
it cannot be removed even though we close the browser
if we are doing sign out or logout then only cookie is deleted
                   

non-persisistent cookie
valid for single session
it can be removed when we closing the browser



              mertis:
                       used to maintain the state of an object.
                       cookie works in an client side
              Demerits:
                        if the browser disable the cookie mean we are not able to store the data in cookie
                        only text information can be added in a cookie

two methods:
addCookie()  -- response.addCookie()  -- return type string

getCookies()   -- request.getCookies()  -- return type Cookie[]


cookie constructor --- parameterized constructor it takes two both string type name and value


some of the methods in cookie:

setMaxAge()
setName() 
setValue()
getName()
getValue()


ADDING COOKIE:

Cookie c = new Cookie("User" , "kaviya");
response.addCookie(c);


DELETING COOKIE:

Cookie c = new Cookie("user" , "");
c.setMaxAge(0)
response.addCookie(c);


GETTING COOKIES:

Cookie[] array = request.getCookies();
for(int i=0;i<array.length;i++)
{
 out.println(c[i].getName()+""+c[i].getValue());
}


HIDDEN FORM FIELD IS AN ANOTHER SESSION TRACKING TECHNIQUES:


it hide the value from one servlet
and display the value in another servlet
by using html tag ot type is "hidden"
this will hide the values
and that hidden value can be displayed in another servlet

Merits:
        it always works whether cookie is disabled or not
Demerits:
        only text information can be used
        extra form submission required for each pages
        it maintains at server side

<input type="hidden" name="username" value="kaviya">

URL REWRITTING TECHNIQUES IN SESSION TRACKING

in the url we can able to send the name value pair 
by that name we can able to access in another servlet
each parameter seperated by ampersand symbol
each parameter value is seperated by = symbol
path and parameter is seperated by ? symbol

url?name=value&name2=value2&name3=value3.....

Merits:
it always works whether cookie is disable or not
extra form submission is not required for each pages

Demerits:
it always works with links
only text information can be used



HTTP SESSION IS AN INTERFACE TECHNIQUES IN SESSION TRACKING

getSession() --- request.getSession()

getSession(boolean create)  -- request 
if there is no current session mean it create when we give boolean value as true


HttpSession session = request.getSession();
session.setAttribute("name","Kaviya");


HttpSession ses = request.getSession(false);
String user = (String)session.getAttribute("name");
out.println(user);
