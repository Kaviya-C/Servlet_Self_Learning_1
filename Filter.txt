Filter -- 

Create a filter file
Configure the filter file in web.xml file


it is an object which is invoked at the time of preprocessing or postprocessing

it is mainly used to perform some filtering tasks 

such as:
        authentication filter -- if password is this mean use this or redirect
        Validation filter -- age should be greater than 18 
        Encryption filter
        Data Compression
        Logging

Merits:
      filter is plugable 
      each entry is defined in web.xml file 
      one entry do not depend another entry
      less maintainanace



CREATION OF FILTER FILE :

New --> Filter

Filter API:
             Filter
             FilterChain
             FilterConfig

Filter --  3  methods 
              init(FilterConfig con) 
              doFilter(HttpServletrequest ,HttpServletresponse , FilterChain)
above method contains filter logic ,automatically executed by the web container 
              destroy()
Filter -- 1 method
             doFilter(HttpServletrequest,HttpServletresponse)
this method used to forward the request and response to another servlet 
filterchain.doFilter(request,response)


CONFIGURE THE FILTER IN WEB.XML File:

Filter is a tag and sub element of web-app
filter-name and filter-class is the tag which belongs to filter tag

Filter-mapping sub element of web-app
contains filter-name and url-pattern


if u want to communicate the servlet and filter then 
two ways:
         use the same url-pattern for both  filter and servlet

         another way   use same logic name 
         include the servlet-name inside of filter mapping tag

 one servlet can have many filter

 one filter can have many servlet
 <url-pattern> /*</url-pattern>
 <url-pattern> /subdirectory/*</url-pattern>
