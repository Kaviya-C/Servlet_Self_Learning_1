Web Container maintains the life cycle of the servlet instance

Servlet Class loaded 
Create an instance of servlet
call the init method
call the service method
call the destroy method

new ready end state

new --- after the instance of servlet is created

ready  -- after the init method it is  in ready state

end -- when it comes to the destroy method it will in end state


first request for the servlet received by the web container ----------> servlet loaded


web container creates an instance of servlet after loadig the servlet 
this servlet creation happens only once
-----------> Servlet instance created


after instance of servlet web container calls the init 
method only once to initialize the servlet ----------->init()



for each request this method is invoked by the web container .------------> service()


web container calls the destroy method before
removing an instance of servlet from the service 
to perform some clean up resources like memory thread etc
----------destroy()
