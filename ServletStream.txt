SERVLET WITH ANNOTATIONS:
            @WebServlet("navigate through link give here")
             by using this annotation we dont need web.xml file to map the servlet
             tomcat 7 above only run this annotation
             before version did not support this annotations


 SINGLE THREAD MODEL INTERFACE:
                it is deprecated now
                at version 2.4 it is there
                marker interface 
                no methods are there
                when u implement SINGLE THREAD MODEL INTERFACE mean only one request is processed at a time
